## 🔓 Crack the Hash

---
#### 🧭 Objectives
- Identify and crack hashed strings using common techniques.
- Understand hash formats and their weaknesses.
- Practise using cracking tools and online resources.

#### 🧠 Skills Explored
- Recognising hash types (_MD5, SHA1, SHA256, etc_.).
- Using wordlists and brute-force methods.
- Leveraging online databases and lookup tools.
- Applying automation to speed up cracking.

#### 🛠️ Tools Overview
- `Hashcat`, `John the Ripper` – for offline hash cracking.
- `CyberChef`, `CrackStation`, `Hash-Identifier` – for analysis and lookup.
- TryHackMe challenge interface – for submitting cracked hashes.

#### 🔄 Steps to Remember (_Hash Cracking Flow_)
1. **Identify Hash Type** – Use tools or format clues.
2. **Select Wordlist** – Choose appropriate dictionary (_e.g. rockyou_).
3. **Run Cracker** – Use Hashcat or John with correct mode.
4. **Validate Output** – Confirm cracked value matches expected format.
5. **Submit & Repeat** – Iterate through challenges with varied hash types.
